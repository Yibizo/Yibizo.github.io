                        My name is Diego Mejía Suárez, and I'm currently a computer science undergraduate looking forward 
                        to graduate in Computer Technologies Engineering. I was born in Mexico and am currently studying 
                        in <a href="https://tec.mx/es/nosotros" target="_blank" class="linkFormat">Tecnológico de Monterrey</a> 
                        CSF in Mexico City. 
                        My current hobbies are software development, deep understanding of technologies, playing videogames and basketball. 
                        Not only that, but I also find the topic of Artficial Intelligence (A.I.) quite interesting and I hope that one day 
                        I'm able to develop something regarding that subject.

                    I would consider myself as an individual that is able to work well with other people. Despite the fact that by 
                    nature I'm an introvert, I value teamwork and love hearing other people's perspective. Furthermore, I believe 
                    that my most valuable skills are my determination to get things done, no matter how hard they may get, as well 
                    as my hearing abilites which have helped me throughout the years to understand different people's perspective.

                    Apart from everything that has been mentioned, I like to get to solutions that are efficient when it comes to
                    coding. Having learnt order of complexities I now comprehend that what's important is not how short the code is,
                    but rather how complex it is and how much time it would theoritically take to execute in its best, average and
                    worst scenario.

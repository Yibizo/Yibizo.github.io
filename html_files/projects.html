                    Coded a bot used for Discord servers from scratch based only on the

                    documentation. In order to invite this bot to a server click 
                    <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=697308103640612936&permissions=0&scope=bot" target="_blank" class="linkFormat">here</a>,
                    and its source code can be found

                    All of its functionalities are listed on when asked for help in a server. However, here are a few things it is able 
                    to do; save notes from users of the server, play hangman, join a voice channel and play a selected song/s, among 
                    many others.

                        One of the first projects I ever worked on while on my Computer Science career,
                        which can be found in
                        <a href="https://github.com/Yibizo/Y1-B0-Discord-Bot.git" target="_blank" class="linkFormat">this</a>
                        repository. While working on this project, I learnt how to implement matrixes and how to search for specific positions 
                        in said matrixes. While this may not be the most complex code or most visually appealing of my potential work, 
                        it showed me that programming truly was my passion, as well as the value of teamwork when it comes to writing extensive code.

                        , and while not the first ever website I've ever worked on, it is the one
                        I've spent the most amount of time trying to polish and tune to my personal liking. Since my school 
                        doesn't mainly teach HTML and CSS, aside from classes separated from the main course, I've had to 
                        teach myself these languages. The main thing I've noticed is that I'm more than capable to teach 
                        myself.
